- Step 0: START

- Step 1: GET LOCATION FOR NEXT VISIT
Actions: 
  Start and Receive information from Next Visit: CCDNUM, RA, DEC, rotation angle, FILTER, AIRMASS, OBS-DATE
Inputs: Location for next visit:
  CCDNUM, RA, DEC, rotation angle, FILTER, AIRMASS, OBS-DATE
Outputs: 
  Formatted dictionary/json object to find templates and calibration in next step
Details to consider:
 Communication method between worker node (here) and Orchestration Manager 
 Potentially the search for the templates for NEXT VISIT could be done here.
 The spatial METADATA for both exposures in each visit should be the same, except for DATE

- Step 2: GET CALIBRATIONS, TEMPLATES AND CATLOGS (ASTROM and DIA
Sources) FOR VISIT
Actions: 
  . Find appropriate Calibrations (i.e. Flats Bias and BPMs) from the Global
  input cache, based on RA, DEC, CCDNUM, FILTER and possibly OBS-DATE.
  . Pull the data, from the Global Input Cache into 
Inputs: 
   Same formatted dictionary with NEXT VISIT Meta-data produced on STEP 1.
Outputs: 
  List and names of calibrations files for NEXT VISIT


Step 3 -- ACQUIRE AND PROCESS SNAP 1
Actions: 
 - Get CCDNUM for EXPOSURE 1 from the distributor into the worker node
 - Run Single Frame Processing (CCDproc) 
Inputs: 
 - Same formatted dictionary with NEXT VISIT Meta-data produced on STEP 1.
 - CCD Image from exposure 1
 - All calibrarions
 - All catalogs
Outputs: Detrended and astrometrically corrected CCD image from snap 1

Step 4 -- ACQUIRE AND PROCESS SNAP 2
Actions: 
 - Get CCDNUM for EXPOSURE 1 from the distributor into the worker node
 - Run Single Frame Processing (CCDproc) 
Inputs: 
 - Same formatted dictionary with NEXT VISIT Meta-data produced on STEP 1.
 - CCD Image from snap 2
Outputs: Detrended and astrometrically corrected CCD image from snap 1
 - All calibrarions
 - All catalogs

Step 5 -- Coaddition of SNAP1 + SNAP2
Inputs: 
  - Imdetrended SNAP1 and SNAP2
Outputs:
  - Coadded image of SNAP1+SNAP2

Step 6 -- REMAPING of template to coadd visit
Inputs: 
  - Image template
  - Header of coaddimage
Output:
  - Remapped template

Step 7 -- Run difference image
  Inputs:
  - Coadd of SNAP1 + 2
  - Remapped template
 Output:
  - Difference Image
  - DIA Sources

Step 8 -- Source Association
 Inputs:
  - External Sources
  - DIA Sources (catalog)
 Outputs:
  - DIA Objects (catalog)

Step 9 -- Alert Generation

Step 10 -- Alter distribution (Kafka connection)
